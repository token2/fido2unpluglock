# FIDO2 Unplug Lock
A tool to lock a Windows10/11 workstation when a FIDO2 key is unplugged

Securing company assets is vital in the contemporary digital sphere. A potent method to achieve this goal is by deploying automatic computer lockout upon the removal of a FIDO2 key. 
Although this functionality is inherent in Microsoft environments for smart cards, this project will provide a solution to broaden this safeguard to FIDO2 security keys for systems that have implemented Passwordless access to Windows workstations.
## An open-source solution
According to our research, such solutions exist, but they are either vendor-locked or require payment and are proprietary. Our goal is to offer a free and open-source solution that will be compatible with any FIDO2 security key, not limited to the ones provided by Token2.
