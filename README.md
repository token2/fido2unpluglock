# FIDO2 Unplug Lock
A tool to lock a Windows10/11 workstation when a FIDO2 key is unplugged

Securing company assets is vital in the contemporary digital sphere. A potent method to achieve this goal is by deploying automatic computer lockout upon the removal of a FIDO2 key. 
Although this functionality is inherent in Microsoft environments for smart cards, this project will provide a solution to broaden this safeguard to FIDO2 security keys for systems that have implemented Passwordless access to Windows workstations.
